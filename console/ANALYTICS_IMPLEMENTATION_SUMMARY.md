## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=G-49H8G09DDC
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_DEBUG=false
```

### Analytics Service Methods
All methods include automatic user context and error handling:

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Tracking a Custom Event
```javascript
// In any component with analytics service injected
this.analytics.trackEvent('custom_action', {
    action_type: 'export_data',
    data_type: 'orders',
    record_count: 150
});
```

### Tracking Business Operations
```javascript
// Track driver assignment
this.analytics.trackDriverAssignment({
    order_id: order.id,
    driver_id: driver.id,
    driver_name: driver.name,
    type: 'success'
});

// Track vehicle creation
this.analytics.trackVehicleAction('created', {
    id: vehicle.id,
    name: vehicle.displayName,
    plate: vehicle.plate_number
});
```

## üìà Data Privacy & Compliance
